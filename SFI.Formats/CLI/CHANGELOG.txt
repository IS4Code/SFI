1.1.1
-----

- `AssemblyAnalyzer` now inherits the same properties as member analyzers.
- Referenced assemblies can be analyzed as references.
- Assembly and normal attributes are unified; specifying them on any metadata element leads to the same properties.
- The `[AssemblyMetadata]` attribute is recognized.
- Reference assemblies preserve `[InternalsVisibleTo]` and internal members that may be visible outside the assembly.
- Better recovery from exceptions during analysis; loading core .NET assemblies works again.


1.1
-----

- Support for analyzing all code metadata elements (namespaces, types, fields, methods etc.), using the CodeOntology vocabulary.
- Links to general identifiers of code elements, using the `clr-namespace:` prefix, are generated.
