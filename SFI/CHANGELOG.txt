1.2.2
----

- Hash algorithms can now be configured to reject particular sources of input.
- Added `DeviceFileInfo` to support custom input sources.
- Added `IImage` as a common interface for images.
- `FileAnalyer` does not add `nfo:FileDataObject` to instances of `IDriveInfo`.


1.2.1
-----

- Fixes to valuetype logging in `EntityAnalyzerProvider`.
- Fixed `SortedMultiTree.Remove` not removing the item properly.


1.2.0
-----

- Fixed `data:` URI escaping.
- Changed the way analyers are stored in the `EntityAnalyzerProvider`, to resolve issues with more complex hierarchies of derived analyzers.
- Added `SortedMultiTree` to implement this change, which maintains a tree-like collection of objects reachable using ordered keys.
- Added `SortedMultiSet` where values are compared using `IComparer` for order but using `IEqualityComparer` for equality, allowing muliple values with the same order key.
- Removed `GlobalObjectComparer` and `TypeInheritanceComparer`, as they were obsoleted by the methods above and no longer used.
- All non-critical formats and analyzers (XML, X.509, etc.) moved to their separate projects.
- All vocabulary items from XIS were added and prefixed with `Xml` in code to distinguish from items with similar names.
