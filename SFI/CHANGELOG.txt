1.3.1
-----

- Added `IUniversalUriFormatter` for formatting nodes of any kind.
- Added the `xyz` namespace.
- Fixed stated dynamic dependencies in code.
- `FormatMemberId` attempts to format partially resolved members too.


1.3
-----

- Hash algorithms can now be configured to reject particular sources of input.
- Added `DeviceFileInfo` to support custom input sources.
- Added `IImage` as a common interface for images.
- Added `Namespace` to represent namespaces in code as an abstraction.
- `FileAnalyer` does not add `nfo:FileDataObject` to instances of `IDriveInfo`.
- A few more URI formatters and formatting options (UUIDs, QNames, CLR members, DocId-like).
- Non-critical exceptions resulting from analysis are analyzed and described, using the XPath Errors vocabulary.
- `TrySet` has a new `object?`-taking overload that accepts other reference types supported by `ILinkedNode`.
- (`Try`)`SetMembers` extension method for container membership properties.
- Reading from `XmlReaderState` now simply returns false instead of exception.
- An instance of `IEntityAnalyzer` is provided as a service to formats and analyzers.
- `DatatypeUri` can be converted back and forth from XML Schema datatypes.
- `PropertyUri` can be inverted, swapping subject and object when used.
- Faster term comparisons (but require vocabularies to match exactly).


1.2.1
-----

- Fixes to valuetype logging in `EntityAnalyzerProvider`.
- Fixed `SortedMultiTree.Remove` not removing the item properly.


1.2
-----

- Fixed `data:` URI escaping.
- Changed the way analyers are stored in the `EntityAnalyzerProvider`, to resolve issues with more complex hierarchies of derived analyzers.
- Added `SortedMultiTree` to implement this change, which maintains a tree-like collection of objects reachable using ordered keys.
- Added `SortedMultiSet` where values are compared using `IComparer` for order but using `IEqualityComparer` for equality, allowing muliple values with the same order key.
- Removed `GlobalObjectComparer` and `TypeInheritanceComparer`, as they were obsoleted by the methods above and no longer used.
- All non-critical formats and analyzers (XML, X.509, etc.) moved to their separate projects.
- All vocabulary items from XIS were added and prefixed with `Xml` in code to distinguish from items with similar names.
